![GRAPHIC SERIES](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensescape/xyz-dots/master/images/dots-title2.jpg)

The GRAPHIC SERIES is a new set of maps created for data visualization. This map series is a continuation of my exploration of the visual language of cartography through the medium of drawing, with a focus on three visual elements: the **dot**, the **line** and the **pixel**.

To learn more about the visual language of cartography, I suggest the following readings:<br/>
