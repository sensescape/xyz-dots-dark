The GRAPHIC SERIES is a new set of maps created for data visualization. This map series is a continuation of my exploration of the visual language of cartography through the medium of drawing, with a focus on three visual elements: the **dot**, the **line** and the **pixel**.

To learn more about the visual language of cartography, I suggest the following readings:<br/>
[Explore the world of form with Morphology](https://www.mapzen.com/blog/morphology/)<br/>
[TRON 2.0 - Creating a Visual Language of Scale](https://geraldinesarmiento.com/#/tron-creating-a-visual-language-of-scale/)<br/>
[Unboxing Bubble Wrap](https://www.mapzen.com/blog/bubble-wrap-carto/)

These maps are built with [Tangram](https://www.mapzen.com/products/tangram/). [Tangram](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram) is an open-source map renderer, originally developed at Mapzen and now a project under the Linux Foundation.
